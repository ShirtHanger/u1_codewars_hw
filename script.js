/*Used this to test code before pasting it in each answer
I decided to leave the line of code I used to test out the .join() function
that I googled (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/958908/how-do-you-reverse-a-string-in-place)*/

let agents = ['Agent 47', 'Jason bourne', 'The Killer', 'Deathstroke', 'The Bride']

fleshy_abomination = agents.join('')

console.log(fleshy_abomination)
